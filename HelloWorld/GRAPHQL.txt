REST and learn some GraphQL

fomo--gatsby to GraphQL

problem with REST is endpoint creep--ex: adding "sub ids" to get smaller bits of large objects, etc.

GraphQL is new API standard
its server exposes a single endpoint
you give and get specific data
client has power

FB made REACT & GraphQL
(REACT=state management)

GraphQLHub.com--playground for learning GraphQL

clients: relay (fb product) and Apollo (open source)

works with Python!
